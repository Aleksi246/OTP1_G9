# Sprint Review Summary

## Sprint Goal

The goal of this sprint was to establish a firm and stable foundation for the project.  
This included designing and implementing the database structure and creating initial tests to validate functionality.

While not many user stories were completed, this was primarily due to the user interface not yet being fully functional.

## Demo Summary

During the sprint review, the following components were demonstrated:

- Database structure  
- Current state of the user interface  
- Unit tests  
- Maven POM configuration  
- JaCoCo code coverage report

## What Went Well

- Trello timelines were followed closely.  
- This provided the team with a clear overview of overall project progress.  

---

## What Could Be Improved

- Timeframes could potentially be shorter, with tasks broken into smaller, more manageable units.  
- Smaller tasks would allow the Scrum Master to more clearly identify bottlenecks, pain points, and areas of success.  
- Earlier UI integration might help complete more user stories within the sprint.
