### Sprint 3 Planning Report – CI/CD Integration & Feature Extension

#Sprint 3: 12.2.2026 - 05.3.2026

**Sprint Goal:**
The goal of Sprint 3 is to extend the functional prototype with core features, strengthen backend logic, and establish a reliable CI/CD pipeline. This sprint also focuses on improving test coverage and preparing the application for a functional review, while introducing basic Docker support.

**Planned Scope:**
During Sprint 3, the team will focus on completing remaining essential features from the product backlog, including GUI–backend integration and necessary authentication functionality. At the same time, we will integrate Jenkins to automate building, testing, and code coverage reporting. Automated unit testing will be expanded to ensure stability and quality. Finally, an initial Docker image will be created and tested locally to prepare for future deployment.

**Key Planned Tasks:**

* Extend the functional prototype with remaining backlog features
* Integrate Jenkins CI/CD pipeline (build, test, JaCoCo coverage)
* Expand unit tests and improve code coverage
* Ensure the system is ready for an end-to-end functional review
* Create and test a local Docker image
* Prepare materials and demonstrations for the sprint review

**Responsibilities & Collaboration:**
The Scrum Master will coordinate sprint planning, track progress, ensure equal team participation, and maintain backlog updates. Development tasks are shared among team members, with commits and documentation tracked in the project repository.

**Expected Outcome:**
By the end of Sprint 3, the application will be feature-complete for functional review, fully integrated with a CI/CD pipeline, supported by automated tests and coverage reports, and runnable via a local Docker image.
